Welcome! I am a dual-title Ph.D. candidate in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at Penn State University, expecting to finish my degree in 2023. I am advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com) and a member of the [Governance and Administration in Networks (GAiN) Lab](http://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html). I use computational methods and experimental appraoches to study internet politics, misinformation diffusion, conflict forecasting, and contentious politics, mostly in the context of the United States. My research has appeared or is forthcoming in *Political Science Research and Methods* and *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*. My dissertation investigates political actors in *Twitch* using various computational methods ranging from machine learning to netwrok analysis and studies protest information diffusion dynamics in Twitter through online experiments.
