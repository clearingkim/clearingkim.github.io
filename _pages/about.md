I am a postdoctoral researcher of [the Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe)](https://osome.iu.edu/) at Indiana University, working with [Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil). I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at The Pennsylvania State University. I was advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com) and a proud member of the [Bruce's Lab](http://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html). I use computational methods and experimental approaches to study political communication, internet politics, misinformation diffusion, conflict forecasting, and content moderation. My research has appeared or is forthcoming in *PLOS One*, *European Journal of Political Reserach*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, and *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*.
