I am a postdoctoral researcher of [the Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe)](https://osome.iu.edu/) at Indiana University, working with [Fil Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil). I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at The Pennsylvania State University. I was advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com) and a proud member of the [Governance and Administration in Networks (GAiN) Lab](http://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html). I use computational methods and experimental approaches to study internet politics, misinformation diffusion, conflict forecasting, and contentious politics, mostly in the context of the United States. My research has appeared or is forthcoming in *European Journal of Political Reserach*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, and *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*. My dissertation investigates political actors in *Twitch* using various computational methods ranging from machine learning to network analysis and studies protest information diffusion dynamics in Twitter through online experiments.
