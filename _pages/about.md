I am a postdoctoral researcher at [the Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe)](https://osome.iu.edu/) at Indiana University, where I work with [Filippo Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil). I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) from The Pennsylvania State University, advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com). I will be joining the Division of Communication & Media at Ewha Womans University as an assistant professor in March 2026.

My research examines how digital platforms and online information environments shape political behavior and public opinion, with a substantive focus on the United States and comparative cases. I combine computational methods, large-scale observational data, and experimental approaches to study political communication on emerging platforms, multi-platform news consumption, misinformation diffusion, content moderation, and the political implications of artificial intelligence.

I have published in leading journals including *PLOS ONE*, *European Journal of Political Reserach*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, and the *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media  (ICWSM)*. My work has been recognized with an Honorable Mention for the 2022 John Sprague Award from the APSA Political Networks section.
