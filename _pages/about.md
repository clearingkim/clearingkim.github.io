**I will be on the job market for AY25-26! Please do not hesitate to contact me (ski15@iu.edu) if you have any related questions.**

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [the Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe)](https://osome.iu.edu/) at Indiana University, where I mainly work with [Filippo Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil). I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at The Pennsylvania State University, where I was advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com). 

My research applies computational methods and experimental approaches to explore political communication, digital politics, misinformation diffusion, conflict forecasting, and content moderation. I am particularly interested in how online platforms shape political discourse and public opinion. Beyond digital politics, I also study democratic norms, partisan dynamics, and public attitudes toward democracy. My work has been published in journals such as *PloS one*, *European Journal of Political Reserach*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, and the *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*.
